    "   The purpose of this example was to use integer programming to produce dog food products as inexpensive as possible, while still meeting nutritional requirements. The potential ingredients include poultry, beef, and corn, which cost 0.005, 0.013, and 0.002, respectively. To find the optimal solution, we identified the decision variables and formulated the objective function and the constraints. The decision variables of this problem were the different percentages of ingredients we include in the can. Since the can is 100g, these percentages also represent the number of grams of each ingredient. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   Afterward, we formulated the objective function, which aimed to minimize the total cost of ingredients per can of dog food. Later, we specified the constraints of the dog food problem. The constraints were the sum of the percentages must equal 100%, and the stated nutritional analysis requirements are met. The results reveal the optimal solution is 80% poultry and 20% corn leading to an objective function value of 44 cents per can."
